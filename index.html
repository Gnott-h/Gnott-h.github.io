        <p style="text-align:center ;">My Favourite Flower
            My favourite flower is rose. I like other flowers too but I find the rose to be the most beautiful among all flowers. It is also called the king of flowers. They come in many colours so it offers great variety.
            
            For instance, they are available in red, pink, white, yellow, blue and more. My favourite is the white rose. Even though the rose has small and sharp thorns on its stem, people love picking roses.
            
            It looks beautiful when it blooms in the garden or is kept at the florist’s shop. Often we see the rose as a symbol of beauty and love. The rose has soft petals and a very sweet fragrance. It comes in use in many ceremonies for decorations purposes.
            
            Moreover, garlands of roses are used in places of worship. Similarly, it is a great flower which always stands out from the rest of the flowers. I have planted roses in my garden as well with the help of my grandfather.</p>
